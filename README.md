# Battleships

This is a repository for the COMP8860 group project from summer 2025. It's a battleship desktop game with multiplayer functionality.

The frontend is a Java Swing application and the backend is a Python Flask app with a small SQLite database.

# Running the game locally (unfinished)

You can run the game locally by launching it from the terminal. 

**Requirements:**

**To run the game:**
1. Start by cloning the master branch of this repository, `git clone https://github.com/HalfFull8860`
2. Enter the newly created local repository, `cd HalfFull8860`
3. If you don't have pymake installed, run `python -m pip install py-make`
